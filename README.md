## FAQ

**What's the actual difference between regular WordPress hosting and managed WordPress hosting?**

Regular WordPress hosting gives you a server with WordPress installed but leaves maintenance, security, updates, and optimization to you. Managed WordPress hosting handles all technical aspects automatically—core updates, security patches, performance optimization, backups, and malware scanning. You focus entirely on content and business growth while specialized teams maintain the infrastructure. Managed hosting costs more but eliminates technical headaches and often delivers better performance through WordPress-specific optimizations.

**How do I know which managed WordPress host fits my specific needs?**

Start by honestly assessing your technical comfort level, traffic expectations, and budget. Beginners benefit from hosts like Bluehost or SiteGround with guided setup and responsive support. Agencies managing multiple client sites prefer Pressable or Flywheel with multi-site dashboards and streamlined workflows. High-traffic businesses requiring maximum uptime should examine WP Engine, Kinsta, or Liquid Web with enterprise infrastructure and support. Most platforms offer money-back guarantees allowing you to test before committing long-term.

**Can these managed hosts actually handle sudden traffic spikes without sites crashing?**

The platforms featured here specifically architect infrastructure for handling traffic variability through auto-scaling technology. Pressable, WP Engine, and Kinsta automatically allocate additional resources when traffic surges occur, preventing slowdowns or crashes. Traditional shared hosting often fails during viral moments because resources are fixed. Managed WordPress hosts maintain resource pools that expand dynamically. However, check plan limits—some hosts charge overages beyond certain visit thresholds while others offer truly unlimited scaling.
